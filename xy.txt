That sounds like a useful project! To help guide you through the development of your document management system, here are some key aspects and features you might consider implementing:

### 1. **User Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Sign-Up/Log-In**: Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.
   - **Password Management**: Implement password recovery and reset functionalities.
   - **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiate between user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) if necessary.

### 2. **Document Management Features**
   - **Upload Documents**: Users should be able to upload files in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, XLSX).
   - **Download Documents**: Users should be able to download their files.
   - **View Documents**: Implement a way for users to preview documents within the application, if needed.
   - **Organize Documents**: Allow users to categorize and tag their documents for easy retrieval.

### 3. **Storage and Security**
   - **File Storage**: Decide where you will store the documents (e.g., cloud storage, local server).
   - **Encryption**: Encrypt documents both in transit and at rest to ensure data security.
   - **Access Control**: Ensure that users can only access their own documents and not those of others.

### 4. **User Interface and Experience**
   - **Dashboard**: Provide a user-friendly dashboard where users can view and manage their documents.
   - **Search and Filter**: Implement search functionality to help users find documents quickly.
   - **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the website is accessible and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 5. **Backup and Recovery**
   - **Regular Backups**: Implement regular backups of documents to prevent data loss.
   - **Recovery Options**: Provide mechanisms for recovering deleted or lost documents.

### 6. **Performance and Scalability**
   - **Efficient Storage**: Use efficient storage solutions to handle large volumes of documents.
   - **Scalability**: Design the system to scale as the number of users and documents grows.

### 7. **Compliance and Legal Considerations**
   - **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
   - **Terms of Service and Privacy Policy**: Clearly outline how user data will be handled and protected.

### 8. **Technical Stack**
   - **Front-End**: Technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
   - **Back-End**: Languages and frameworks like Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails, etc.
   - **Database**: Consider using relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) based on your needs.
   - **File Storage**: Services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar options.

### 9. **Testing and Deployment**
   - **Testing**: Implement both unit and integration tests to ensure functionality.
   - **Deployment**: Use a CI/CD pipeline for smooth deployment and updates.

### 10. **Monitoring and Support**
   - **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring to track performance and detect issues.
   - **User Support**: Provide support channels for users to report issues and get help.
